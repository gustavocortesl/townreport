# TownReport
TownReport has been created to help local government to know where the problems are. This is achieved with the cooperation of citizens which can report any issue (breakdowns, flaws, etc.) and so alert town maintenance services about it. Those responsible for the maintenance of public facilities can allocate resources and track the progress of works.
